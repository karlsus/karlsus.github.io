                Brief History of Palawan Island
			</h1>
				<p id="before">
					Before Palawan turned into "The Best Island in the World" becoming a noteworthy visitor goal for tourists, Palawan was only a long island area within the nation of the Philippines. Its journey towards being one of the most beautiful islands known to man was anything but easy because the island itself had to go through various challenges having to go through dull long stretches of colonization, starting with one colonizer then onto the next.

					The early history of this area was controlled by a group of scientists driven by Dr. Robert Fox who has discovered the confirmation of life from the remaining parts they uncovered in the Tabon Cave – demonstrating that man has constantly lived in Palawan for over 50,000 years. They likewise found the remaining parts of those they called "Tabon Man" in the region of Quezon. In spite of the fact that the source of the buckle tenants was not yet settled, anthropologists believe that they originated from Borneo. Up to this point, investigations are being done in the Tabon Cave which was named as "the Cradle of Philippine Civilization" to discover more profound things and remains that could be helpful to the study.

				Ancient Times
			</h2>

				<p id="ancient">
					It is believed that the Palaw’ans and the Tagbanuas are direct descendants of Palawan’s earliest settlers. They developed an informal form of government, their own alphabet, and their own trade system with sea-borne merchants.
					Approximately between 220 to 263 AD, a new wave of recent migrants came during a period called the “Three Kingdoms” where ‘Little dark people‘ who were living in Anwei province in South China were driven South by Han people. Some settled in Thailand while others scattered farther south to Indonesia, Sumatra, and Borneo. These people are what most Filipinos call Aetas and Negritos from whom Palawan’s Batak tribe descended.
					In AD 982, ancient Chinese traders regularly visited the islands. This was attested by the pottery, china and other artifacts that have been recovered from caves and waters of Palawan.

                    Amid the twelfth Century, Malay outsiders touched base in Palawan with a large portion of its settlements controlled by a Malay chieftain. These individuals developed agrarian items, for example, rice, ginger, coconuts, sweet potatoes, sugarcane, and bananas. They likewise raised creatures, for example, pigs, goats, and chickens. Angling, cultivating, and chasing by the utilization of bamboo traps and bowguns were their monetary exercises.

                    In light of Palawan's vicinity to Borneo, southern bits of the island of Palawan were under the control of the Sultanate of Brunei for over two centuries. . During the same period, trade relations become of trend and intermarriages among the natives and foreign traders such as the Chinese, Japanese, Arab, and the Hindu have also become common. The blending of races brought about an unmistakable type of people groups in Palawan that might be described by both physical stature and highlight.

                    After the death of Magellan, the remaining members of his fleet landed to Palawan where the bounty of the land saved them from starvation, thus, named it “Land of the Promise” by Magellan’s chronicler, Antonio Pigafetta.
                    The northern Calamianes Islands were first to come under Spanish authority and were later declared as a separate province from mainland Palawan. In the early 17th Century, Spanish friars sent out missionaries in Cuyo, Agutaya, Taytay, and Cagayancillo but they ended up meeting resistance from the Moro community who were occupying the place. Later before the 18th century, Spain began building churches that are enclosed by garrisons for protection against Moro raids in the towns of Cuyo, Taytay, Linapacan, and Balabac. In 1749, the Sultanate of Brunei surrendered southern Palawan to Spain.
                    In 1818, the entire island of Palawan which was then called Paragua was organized as a single province and named it Calamianes with Taytay being its capital. However, in 1858, the province was divided into two provinces namely Castilla, covering all the municipalities in the northern part with Taytay as its capital, and Asturias in the southern mainland with Puerto Princesa as its capital. Later on during the Spanish colonization in the Philippines, Cuyo became the second capital of Palawan from 1873 to 1903.

In 1903, according to the Philippine Commission Act No. 1363, the territory was redesigned to incorporate its southern bits and renamed it into Palawan, and Puerto Princesa was proclaimed as its capital.

                    The Palawan Massacre

                        In order to prevent the rescue of prisoners of war byt the advancement of their American allies during World War II, on December 14, 1944, units of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army under the command of General Tomoyuki Yamashita herded the remaining 150 prisoners of war in Puerto Princesa into three covered trenches which were then set on fire using barrels of gasoline. The prisoners who tried to escape the flames were shot down while others attempted to escape by climbing over a cliff that ran along one side of the trenches but was later on hunted down and killed. Only 11 of these soldiers escaped from the slaughter and between 133 to 141 people were killed.
                        The massacre is the basis for the recently published book Last Man Out: Glenn McDole, USMC, Survivor of the Palawan Massacre in World War II by Bob Wilbanks, and the opening scenes of the 2005 Miramax film, The Great Raid. A memorial has been erected on the site and McDole, in his eighties, was able to attend the dedication. The site, at present, is known as the Plaza Cuartel that is found next to the Cathedral in Puerto Princesa.

                        Amid the primary period of the Battle of the Gulf of Leyte, simply off the bank of Palawan, two United States Naval Submarines, USS Dace (SS-247) and USS Darter (SS-227) assaulted a Japanese cruiser team that was driven by Admiral Takeo Kurita, sinking his lead (in which he survived) Atago, and her sister transport Maya. Darter later steered into the rocks that evening and was abandoned by USS Nautilus (SS-168). The island was freed from the Japanese Imperial Forces by a team comprising of Filipino and American military staff between February 28 and April 22, 1945.

                        All these are a long way from what we see of Palawan now, a home of excellence and culture with a dull history and an assembly of hair-raising accounts of war and colonization. Its history is an intense verification that Palawan isn't just about the normal assets, white sandy shorelines, long sandbars, blue crystalline waters, rich marine biodiversity and bottomless environment. It is home to culture, legacy, and history. Something everybody could gain from.
